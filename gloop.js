/*
	gloop.js
	A game loop library.
	Features:
	- Set your desired FPS and it will run your updateFunc() that many times per second.
	- If lagging it will skip draws, to make your updateFunc() always run at the same speed on any device.
	- If the device can render 120 FPS and your game is set to 60, this will make sure it doesn't run extra fast on those devices.
	- Get the current FPS the game is rendering at. (gloop.dps)
	- Supports old devices/browsers including IE11 and iOS9.
	Does not include:
	- No delta timing. This is because delta timing can result in different outcomes on slow devices, such as bullets skipping through enemies.
